help run Demo1.m and Demo2.m.

Demo1.m and Demo2.m are main functions of the codes.

Run Demo1.m and Demo2.m respectively to show the effect of robust CUBE algorithm and standard CUBE algorithm.

Demo1.m shows the effect of robust CUBE algorithm, and Demo2.m shows the effect of standard CUBE algorithm.

Here we show an example of numerical test with spatial outliers.
